# PyCheckers - Checkers made with python

## What it can do as of the latest release

- Simulate a game of checkers

## What it's missing

- Sound effects
- Polishing
- Lots of optimization
- Some basic game rules (Only one piece can be captured per turn)
- Other small features

## Background info

This is the project I've made for my ICS2O course final project. I had around two weeks (16 days) to make a fully functional program that falls under the categories:

• Graphing programs
• Computer simulations
• Musical programs
• Statistical programming
• Game programming (i.e. arcade,
adventure, sports, card games, etc.)
• Computer graphics (Serpinski curves,
Mandelbrot sets, animation)
• Artificial intelligence

In my case, I chose game programming and decided to give myself a challenge and try to recreate checkers. While creating this project, I've learned a lot of new concepts (OOP, for example) and have encountered a lot of bugs, but in the end it was a fun experience.
